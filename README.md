# What's this Project About?

This project creates a simple solar system model using circular motion equations and the React state to manage position, along with controls for the user to interact with. It was a simple way to learn more about React state and how it can be used. I'm particularly happy with the way the CSS Radial gradient can be adjusted depending on the individual planet or moon's position, to simulate the motion around it's orbital center :)
